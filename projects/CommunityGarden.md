Community Garden

## Category

Application, NFT

## Project Description

Community Garden is a social dApp, an NFT platform, a plant exchanger, and a plant doctor app, all in one app. Where people come together and help each other to solve their plant problems.

Creators and makers can sell NFTs, garden communities can set up a profile, and receive tips and donations from their community. Viewers can go to the platform to check works from the different creators and community gardens, see details from specific NFT, mint or donate NTFs, and unlock exclusive content.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p

At the moment we are using NFT.Storage to save NFTs and Textile/eth to store metadata for Garden communities such: names, locations, descriptions, images, wallet addresses, and more. We are also using NFTPort for minting and donating NFTs to Garden communities. This is a win-win situation for our Garden communities because they don't have to pay any transaction fees.
